# mi-r3-trx
Welcome !!
This project is for Xiaomi MI Router 3 or R3! The goal Of the project is to share compiled padavan firmware for the router. So you don't have to compile the firmware every time after new release or update! 
And also u don't have to flash the router for new build!


First Follow the tutorial to install padavan in your router! 

https://github.com/rern/MI_Router3_Padavan_installation

after succcessfull installation! 

u can download the released  	MI3.X.X.X-X_X.trx file from My repo! 

and login to your router then goto 
Administration> Firmware Upgrade > New Firmware File >click on Browse >
Then select the downloaded trx
Then click on upload to install the trx! 
It will take some time!
after completing that the router would boot normally without any setting reset! 

Thanks!!
